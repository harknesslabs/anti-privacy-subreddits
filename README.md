Some subreddits have their automod setup to automatically catch any posts that contain certain keywords, pertaining to mass-edit/deletion software.
Examples are:
Shreddit, Redact and github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite

The automod setup will look for terms such as the above names or phrases like "Mass deleted" or "Mass edited" to remove your comments and them possibly ban you (see below)

This is a issue because the point of editing your reddit posts and leaving them there in place is so that third party websites can re-scrape your comments and update them in place. 
It is common knowledge that many of these websites will update their data to use the freshest comments/edits but will not remove deleted posts. 
As such, simply deleting your posts or comments will possibly keep them alive forever on third party websites.

It is important to know that while nobody can doubt that it is incredibly annoying to search for something and then see the result being "edited, removed my data" - that we must still acknowledge that the privacy of the individual poster is more important than the general reddit experience.
Reddit, its moderators or its admins do not come before your privacy when it comes to deleting or editing your past posts. Their experience comes second. Privacy is a hard fought right being stripped from us more and more every day and must be respected as such.
Users who want to protect themselves from AI Harvesting bots, stylometry attacks or other reasons have every right to anonymize their content. Punishing them is antithetical to what is best for the user itself.

As such, below we are updating and maintaining a list of subreddits that actively look for certain keywords and will automatically delete your post at a minimum and possibly ban and message you at a maximum.

For all subreddits below, Redact itself has made it so that all edits are now untraceable, with no identifying strings or tags. 
This will make things very frustrating for moderators, which is something we DO NOT want to do. The point of having the string saying that something was "mass edited" serves several purposes:
1: It lets future users know that this post was removed not because of something specific to the post or its contents, but because the user scrubbed all of their data
2: It lets other users who see that post know what software they used to accomplish that goal
3: It lets moderators of the subreddit easily see that this was a automated edit and does not need further moderator action.

Because reddit moderators have hooked into previously used terms to be antagonist to user privacy, we have removed those terms moving forward for the following subreddits. Now, only random words and chatgpt based gibberish will be edited in place.
